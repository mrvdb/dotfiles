# What to do with mail that is incoming
# Messages have just been fetched by mbsync and notmuch new has run
# Initials tags are in place (i.e. new;unread by default)
# Basically we want to replicate sieve here, if not already taken care
# of automatically.

# Everything in folder Junk is spam
+spam -unread -new -inbox      folder:Junk

# Things that are in Trash folder need specific tags
+deleted -unread -new -inbox   folder:Trash

# Clear things that are deleted, but not everything.
# Just a convenience as these get physically deleted at some point anyway.
# Anything that has the spam tag (not the header, this tag was
# assigned by us!!) is not 'new' and 'unread' anymore
# TODO: if not in folder:Junk they should be moved to Learn/Spam (and be removed by server)
# TODO: tag:deleted should be moved to Trash where they can retire
-new -unread -inbox            (tag:deleted or tag:spam)
