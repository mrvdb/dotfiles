# What to do with mail that is incoming
# Messages have just been fetched by mbsync and notmuch new has run
# Initials tags are in place (i.e. new;unread by default)
# Basically we want to replicate sieve here, if not already taken care
# of automatically.

# Everything in folder Junk is spam
+spam -unread -new -inbox  folder:Junk

# Things that are in Trash folder need specific tags
+deleted -unread -new -inbox folder:Trash

# Clear things that are deleted, but not everything.
# Just a convenience as these get physically deleted at some point anyway.
-new -unread -inbox tag:deleted
