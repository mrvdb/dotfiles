-- Start a few programs to make our life easier We do not use dex -a
-- because that starts a bit too much, but in theory that is what we
-- should do if we want to have everything around that gnome does in
-- the other session which is ubuntu's default.
-- I don't want that because the whole point is to be more in control
-- and have a leaner setup where possible.

-- TODO Starting gnome-settings-daemon should not be necessary (see
-- awesome wiki page on this)
-- We still start it for the following reasons:
-- 1. The theme-ing is easier to manager and in sync with the "normal" gnome session;
-- 2. Configured keyboard shortcuts in gnome won't work
-- otherwise. (TODO: move them to a lower level? *sigh*)
--    Q: can this be done with autokey which we are running for other reasons anyways
--    A: yes
-- â†’ OPTION:using autokey for the global shortcuts ---> BUGGY, not suitable
-- 3. Some Fn keys are apparently handled by gnome-settings-daemon
-- 4. Handling the display settings with gnome control center is very comfy
