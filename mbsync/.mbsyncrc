# mbsync configuration
#
# Concept:
# - imap server holds the long term reference data
# - local is maildir so it's the fastest and clients will not have to know server specifics
#
# Other tools involved in the setup:
# - notmuch for indexing and simple client in emacs
# - gnus, the long term goal client in emacs
# - astroid, gui mua on top of notmuch
# - systemd for running mbsync periodically
